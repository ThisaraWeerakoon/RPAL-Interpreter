# RPAL-Interpreter
The project involved developing a software system to analyze and parse the RPAL programming language, including constructing a lexical analyzer and creating an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This AST was then transformed into a Standardize Tree (ST), and the system executed RPAL programs using a Compiled Stack Environment (CSE) machine.
